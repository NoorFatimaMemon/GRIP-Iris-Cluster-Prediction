# GRIP-Iris-Cluster-Prediction

This repository is dedicated to the task of predicting the optimum number of clusters within the Iris dataset using unsupervised learning techniques. It provides comprehensive resources for data analysis, model training, and visualization.


This is a sample code written by me for training the "iris data", which is widely available. The implementation takes place within the Google Colab environment.

Current functionalities of this codebase:

1. Generates a summary of the Iris dataset and provides an overview in the Google Colab.
2. Performs unsupervised learning to determine the optimum number of clusters in the Iris dataset and visualizes the results.
3. Displays a pair plot of the Iris data, showcasing the relationships between different features.
4. Utilizes the elbow method to graphically identify the optimal number of clusters for the Iris dataset.
